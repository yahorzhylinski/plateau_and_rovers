# plateau_and_rovers

All code is at /code folder.

Tests are at /code/tdd.
To run tests you need to install gem rspec.
The commands to run tests:

```ruby
cd code/tdd/
rspec **/*.rb
```

And you will get smth like this:

```bash
yahor@yahor-pc:~/projects/plateau_and_rovers/code/tdd$ rspec **/*.rb
..........................

Finished in 0.00513 seconds (files took 0.08498 seconds to load)
26 examples, 0 failures
```

Command to run program with your test data from root directory
```ruby
ruby main.rb 
ruby
```

It will create a file(with random name) where you can find the result.

Also i didn't check a situation when one rover will be stay on another rover itinerary. If you will give me more i can handle this case.

Feel free to ask me about my code: zhilinskyegor@gmail.com

Thanks
